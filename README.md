#Emotion Detection Web Application
Welcome to the Emotion Detection Web Application project! In this project, you will assume the role of a software engineer tasked with developing an AI-based web application for detecting emotions in text inputs. Below is an overview of the tasks you will be performing:

Tasks:
Clone the project repository: Begin by cloning the project repository to your local machine to get started with the development process.

Create an emotion detection application: Utilize the Watson Natural Language Processing (NLP) library to develop the core functionality of the application, allowing it to accurately detect emotions in text inputs.

Format the output of the application: Implement a formatting mechanism to present the output of the emotion detection application in a user-friendly and comprehensible manner.

Package the application: Package the completed application into a deployable format, ensuring all dependencies and resources are included.

Run Unit tests on your application: Develop and execute unit tests to verify the correctness and robustness of the application's functionalities.

Web deployment of the application using Flask: Utilize the Flask web framework to deploy the emotion detection application as a web service, making it accessible via web browsers.

Incorporate error handling: Implement comprehensive error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected scenarios and provide meaningful feedback to users.

Run static code analysis: Perform static code analysis using appropriate tools to identify and rectify potential issues, ensuring the overall code quality meets industry standards.

Feel free to refer to the project documentation and resources provided to assist you throughout the development process. Good luck, and happy coding!
